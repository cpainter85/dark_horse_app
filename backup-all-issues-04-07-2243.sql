Plus another installment of Roma from John Workman and finally everyone's favorite hunk of stone- Concrete by Paul Chadwick.</i></p><h2>Chapters</h2><p style=""><b>Concrete:</b> Concrete has agreed to help a man look for his lost brother who's last location was in the woods. The man's brother (Adam) is a stuntman who often takes enough fuel to fly and sleeps under the wing of his biplane. Concrete leaps from a plane into a lake after spotting some bears (which he is a little afraid of) and the crashed biplane of Adam. He finds that Adam has a fractured leg, arm and finger and takes him to the rendezvous point where they will be rescued by dawn, a word Adam keeps repeating. Suddenly, Concrete hears a scream and finds that a woman is being attacked by, you guessed it, a bear. Concrete manages to fight the bear off but get's hit in the eyes and blinded. The woman who's name is Dawn, cleans the blood from Concrete's eyes and turns out to be a friend of Adams they all head to the rendezvous point where Adam is rescued and Concrete and Dawn set off and walk to Logging Road. (Because he's too heavy to go in the plane.)</p><p style=""><b>The Masque:</b> Two men arguing in a church in Manhattan about a man named Montoya. Cut to Newark airport where a group of what are assumed F.B.I agents are tying to find Montoya, after some squabbling he is apprehended but it turns out it's the wrong man. Montoya is then spotted and is chased into a bizarre room. The Masque appears and is subsequently shot, the walls behind him start to bleed and fill up the room. One of the shooters thinks that the reason the room is filling up with blood is because they shot a priest, the other is adamant who they shot was not a priest. All of a sudden Fidel Castro appears and one of the men open fires but kills his friend. A head is then sent through the baggage carousel and a strange man asks for a taxi to Manhattan.</p><p style=""><b>Sole Survivors:</b> An Alien takes cover behind a rock and is in a Mexican stand off with another lone alien (Different species). The sun beats down on our characters making the many mouthed alien pine for it's green and blue world, as it recalls the events which led it to be in this predicament, of the attempted escape and crash of it's ship and how it is the "Sole Survivor" along with it's vertebrata enemy. The alien then hears the familiar sound of water dripping into a pool and makes a break for the water, losing a limb is a small price to pay for living as the alien loses an arm in the gun fire and drinks the sweet water it has been coveting only to meet an end befitting Jona.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/25647-3739-28505-1-dark-horse-presents.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/25647-3739-28505-1-dark-horse-presents.jpg	Concrete; The Masque; Sole Survivors	2	1987-09-01	2015-04-07 21:48:59.355816	2015-04-08 04:32:14.420311

2283	6	100429	<p style="">Once a slave, now an angry rebel, its Conan versus the full might of the sorcerous kingdom of Hyperborea! With the lives of his allies and his lover in the balance, the swordsman must triumph over the most ancient and corrupt kingdom of his world or watch them die! Original Conan author Robert E.

The haunting dead of this ancient place offer no solace, but they want nothing more than for Conan to join their dank and lifeless company. </span><br/></div>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17880/350324-10612-127067-1-conan.JPG	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17880/350324-10612-127067-1-conan.JPG	The Serpent	156	2006-07-01	2015-04-07 21:50:47.133625	2015-04-08 01:45:58.74891

Victim of a vengeful curse, Conan's steadfast companion must be laid to rest again, despite having already suffered a grisly death, but time is short. The Cimmerian must dispatch his old friend before the curse can claim all he has left . . . his very soul. Unfortunately, that isn't even Conan's most immediate concern. Surrounded by a demonic legion controlled by a power-hungry sorcerer, the barbarian and his comrades must stop the madman before he can conjure the very god of death itself and cross the fearsome deity into their realm to wreak havoc on all of Hyboria. It will take everything the warriors have to stop the forces of darkness before it's too late!</i>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17880/377871-10612-129341-1-conan.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/1/17880/377871-10612-129341-1-conan.jpg	The Hand of Nergal	156	2008-05-01	2015-04-07 21:50:47.144535	2015-04-08 01:45:59.458332

79	19	39014	<p style=""><em>Overview</em></p><p style="">This series of reformatted and newly colored newspaper strip reprints is winding to a close. And lest anyone forget, Han Solo's still got a bounty on his head -- and there are plenty of opportunists who are dead-set on collecting. Han and the Rebels' recent adventures throughout the galaxy have not gone completely unnoticed by those interested in taking advantage of the easy money. In fairly short order, they meet up with an old foe who turns out to be a friend, and a couple of enemies -- who will have a much greater role to play in Return of the Jedi. A series of adventures ultimately winds up with our heroes crash-landing on Hoth, searching for a treasure which may or may not exist. This penultimate issue is graced by a brilliant new cover by veteran comic-book artist George Evans.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/34924-4861-39014-1-classic-star-wars.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/34924-4861-39014-1-classic-star-wars.jpg	A New Beginning (part 2)	30	1994-05-01	2015-04-07 21:48:26.249171	2015-04-08 04:26:24.074112

Bridges are crumbling, rivers are washing past retaining walls, and everything in Edo is floating away, including our vengeful ronin, his foe, and his little boy. In an ironic show of samurai respect, little Cub Daigoro gets saved by the conniving Retsudo Yagyu. And proving he can lend a hand, too, Lone Wolf Ogami pulls someone to safety as well -- but maybe he should have let him drown. Eventually, the two opposing master swordsmen dry off and go head to head in a sword fight of a thousand stances and couple of days length.

Now that he's in the midst of a family of vampires ("others," as they prefer to be called), and they're under attack by an invading army of rampaging zombies, Blud needs to choose a side, and doing so will seal his fate forever.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/787/190182-18318-114213-1-city-of-others.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/787/190182-18318-114213-1-city-of-others.jpg		183	2007-05-01	2015-04-07 21:48:40.681915	2015-04-08 04:31:01.780854

As the doctor isolates the problem, it becomes apparent that the element he seeks cannot be found on this world. His only chance is to send an unsuspecting Goon and Franky to a parallel universe to find the key to his antidote.</p><p style="">Goon and Franky must fight an absurd array of strange and otherworldly monsters from out of space and time in classic Wally Wood tradition.

Now, a hyper-advanced cyborg called Motoko Aramaki -- a fusion of multiple entities and identities -- heads the investigative department of the giant multi-national, Poseidon Industrial, deploying remotely controlled humanoid surrogates around the globe as on-the-ground agents. When a herd of specially-bred pigs used to clone human organs for transplant are slaughtered, Motoko dispatches herself through cyberspace and utilizing surrogate cyborgs at far-flung locales to do the heavy lifting, Matoko hunts down the attackers, battling online and on the ground, but there may be more to the mystery than meets the eye...even the all-seeing eye of artificial intelligence.

455	1	127569	<p style=""><em>Overview</em></p><p style="">Grand. Operatic. Powerful. Matt Wagner's <em>Grendel</em>, a mainstay in the comics arena for decades, has always been a touchstone of eclecticism and excitement. Unfortunately, many of the original stories have been long out of print and are conspicuously absent from the back-issue bins; therefore, in response to readers' demands, Matt Wagner has compiled this Grendel history book. <em>Grendel Cycle</em> begins with an all-new, eight-page primer, written and fully painted by Matt Wagner (<em>Grendel: Devil Quest</em>, <em>Sandman Mystery Theatre</em>), giving new readers a lavish introduction to the Grendel mythos, while refreshing the memories of those who have been there all along. This is followed by an extensive overview of the lost stories and the Grendel concept itself that combines text and new artwork by the original series artists -- Wagner, Arnold Pander (<em>Triple*X</em>), Bernie Mireault (<em>The Jam</em>), Ron Turner, John K. Snyder III (Harlan Ellison's <em>Dream Corridor</em>), Jay Geldhof, Tim Sale (<em>Batman Halloween Special</em>, <em>Deathblow</em>), and Pat McEown (<em>Grendel Tales: Homecoming</em>) -- all returning for the first time to the characters that made them "hot." Special features include a timeline of events and a cover gallery showcasing the cover artwork from the first 50 issues. This book is a must for every Grendel fan. Don't be the last on your block to get the full story.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/462/357317-21216-127569-1-grendel-cycle.png	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/462/357317-21216-127569-1-grendel-cycle.png		395	1995-10-01	2015-04-07 21:48:56.300125	2015-04-08 04:32:09.448238

Damn kid. There's gonna be comics, and rollergirls, and all manner of Southern hostility, served up Goon style. There'll also be an announcement about the next thing you can expect from The Goon, in this year of relatively low, but increasingly bizarre, output from Eric.</p><p style="">I'm writing this immediately upon my return from New York Comic Con, the second biggest U.S. comics show, where the crew from Dark Horse hung out with Powell and Samantha for a few days in the freezing cold. At the show, someone gave Powell a little sculpture of his most notorious character Satan's Sodomy Baby. The DH legal team says I can't post the picture of the baby here, but this was a hell of a sculpture. Powell might put pictures up on his own site, but that'd be a bad idea for a guy living in Tennessee.</p><p style="">While at the show, Powell, Sierra, Sam, and I got to sit down and figure out some finishing touches to the designs for the new line of Goon trade paperbacks. This summer we'll be collecting The Return of Labrazio, the storyline from Goon Year, in three volumes. Amy Arendts, the designer on The Goon, as well as B.P.R.D., Rex Mundi, and dozens of other books from Dark Horse, has been diligently hammering at this new design for The Goon for weeks, so when I say we got to "figure out the finishing touches," what I mean is logging another batch of requests and directions for Amy to figure out. It might be too much to ask for the readers to get excited about the design of the trade paperback, but on Sunday night in Eric's hotel room, over pizza and SKYY vodka, we were alternately high-fiving each other and staring in desperation at the computer fearing we were dreaming an impossible dream.</p><p style="">Goon Volume 7: A Place of Heartache and Grief hits stores June 3, with the remaining two volumes of The Return of Labrazio following at two-month intervals. In the meantime, look for the anniversary issue of The Goon on March 4!</p><p style="">P.S. Read about Eric's thoughts on art in an interview conducted by 7-year-old grade schooler Mina Bella Kreiter. And if you're around, join us for the Goon's 10th Anniversary Party in Nashville, Tennessee.

Instead, her "death" is linked to Scythe and Trouvaille, who have been running experiments through which souls are stripped from bodies, the souls "rendered" and then replaced with beings from another dimension. Trouvaille captures Elisa and shows her the tape. From the tape, she learns that she was a killer for Crux, that Trouvaille, aided by Scythe, tried ripping Elisa's soul from her body, but in the middle of the procedure, Cameron Nemo briefly appeared. Then, Elisa vanished. Silhouette is shown to be back in control of Margo's body while Margo's soul awaits rendering. Elisa escapes and fights Silhouette, who escapes, still in control of Margo's body. Elisa then kills Trouvaille. Elisa also has learned that Focus was in league with Trouvaille and soon discovers the same about Peter. She suggests Peter kill himself, while Focus informs Elisa that Elisa used to be one of the Furies. Soon, Elisa finds Cameron Scythe. Nemo, who reveals that as a part of Elisa's subconscious, he has always known her, is sent back to Elisa's hell. Margo, now a being like Elisa, appears and shoots Scythe through the skull, killing him.</p><p style="">* V2, #7-15: Elisa, Concordia and Margo go to Hoyo Grande to ask King Tiger for help. Instead, they end up helping a very down and out Tiger regain his mojo and battle the shapeshifting "Szothstromael" clan. Elisa also has a revelatory encounter with the Man From the Vortex, who "reboots" her brain. This allows Elisa to recall that her real father, Dan Deerlane, was shot down by her adoptive father, in front of her eyes, when she was very young and that the pain of this deadened her to that of others, leading to her living the life of a Fury assassin. Silhouette returns, having used Trouvaille's technology to transfer more beings into the bodies of Scythe's remaining followers. Sent as ghost-hunters, they attack Elisa and her friends. Upon Failing, Trouvaille, whose body is dead yet whose essence now exists within his armor, joins them to take down Elisa and fulfill his experiments. They take Margo and Concordia, but Peter returns to aid Elisa in her battle. Margo's body is recovered, Silhouette is defeated and Trouvaille, along with the hunters, appear to be disposed of. Giving Peter a solid "get lost" Elisa leaves with her newly "re-alive" sister.</p><h4>Collected Editions</h4><ul><li><a href="http://www.comicvine.com/ghost-omnibus-4-vol-4/4000-387236/" data-ref-id="4000-387236">Ghost Omnibus vol. 4</a> (#1-11)</li><li><a href="http://www.comicvine.com/ghost-omnibus-5-volume-5/4000-450536/" data-ref-id="4000-450536">Ghost Omnibus vol. 5</a> (#12-22)</li></ul>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/2787290-01.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/2787290-01.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:03.815741	2015-04-07 21:12:53.622988	1998

While on a patrol to find thieves responsible for stealing machine parts, Drago and three other warriors discover children in the aftermath of a Karanitani raid. They resolve to take the children back to their clan until the refugees all die mysteriously, contaminated by a biological/radioactive weapon identified only as "forbidden weapons." Drago is selected to return to the Agram clan and warn the half-blind Grendel-General Vlado that the Karanitani are using these weapons, while the others commit ritual suicide in order to have "warriors' deaths."</p><p style="">Meanwhile, a simple-minded creature created by the same radiation kills some of the Agram's livestock for food. When Petar, the Grendel assigned to shepherd the livestock, attacks the man-beast, it retaliates and smashes his head with a rock. The village mayor, Three-Teeth (later Two-Teeth, and still later Mayor No-Teeth), conscripts the Grendels to kill the monster.</p><p style="">Drago, having returned and warned of the Karanitani weapons, volunteers to deal with the monster and die an honorable death, rather than let his illness enfeeble him and kill him. Vlado reluctantly agrees, though he does not believe in Drago's success. The Grendel-General secretly plans for <a href="/zora/4005-26067/" data-ref-id="4005-26067">Zora</a>, his lieutenant, to follow Drago and kill the creature and put Drago out of his misery. Drago makes his farewells to his younger brother, <a href="//www.comicvine.com/goran/4005-26073/" data-ref-id="4005-26073">Goran</a>. Zora gives Drago a canteen that she claims belonged to her father as an apparent gesture of peace between the two warriors.

123	Hieroglyph	6374	<p style="">One of the few books to harness the sheer visual edge that comic books will always have over written fiction, Hieroglyph, much like Ricardo Delgado's previous project (Age of Reptiles), lets the art do the talking. A (human) space explorer lands on a strange planet which seems to comprise of giant bugs as its dominant life form. He pursues these beings in the name of science, falling deeper into the pitcher plant trap that forms the core of book one. The second book details his effort to both understand this mammoth insect colony and its confounding ritual as well as make a run for his life. The story is, of course, not very original, but Delgado's art work (he can draw more than Dinosaurs, yep) breathes incredible life within the confines of every panel, most of which span the entire page.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/40857-6374-46107-1-hieroglyph.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/40857-6374-46107-1-hieroglyph.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:03.183921	2015-04-07 21:12:54.223728	1999

141	Fray	7077	<p style="">Hundreds of years in the future, Manhattan has become a deadly slum, run  by mutant crime-lords and disinterested cops. Stuck in the middle is a  young girl who thought she had no future, but learns she has a great  destiny. In a world so poisoned that it doesn't notice the monsters on  its streets, how can a street kid like Fray unite a fallen city against a  demonic plot to consume mankind? Joss Whedon, the celebrated creator of  <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, brings his vision to the future in  this unique tale. As inventive in the comics medium as in that of  television or film, Whedon spins a complex tale of a skilled thief  coming of age without the help of friends or family, guided only by a  demonic Watcher. <br/>  </p><h3>Collected Trades</h3><a href="../../fray-future-slayer/49-18751/" rel="nofollow">Fray: Future Slayer</a> (1-8)	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/43389-7077-50749-1-fray.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/43389-7077-50749-1-fray.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:03.273043	2015-04-07 21:12:54.270469	2001

241	Aliens: Havoc	19333	<p style="">This is a must read even if you are not a big fan of the Alien creatures. The story is about a rescue party sent to a ship that they had lost transmission to. Well it turns out that everyone on the ship is dead except for a scientist that figured out a way to disconnect his consciousness from his body. So the scientist ends up jumping from person to person in the rescue party (every page) and every time he does the art changes. Even though this was made 10 years ago it is way ahead of its time even now.<br/></p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/2754102-01.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/2754102-01.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:03.717063	2015-04-07 21:12:54.620084	1997

She has a sister, <a href="/margo-cameron/4005-72027/" data-ref-id="4005-72027"> Margo Cameron</a>, with whom she slowly reconciles and moves in with, as well as two recently sober parents, who are eventually murdered by a shadowy psionic that seems to know something about her past as a reporter, apparently slain over a story she was covering. Her natural weakness is jade, which keeps her from "ghosting" out and being able to pass through objects. She discovers she has the ability to teleport ("jump"), but must cross a sort of "<a href="/hell/4020-42471/" data-ref-id="4020-42471"> Hell</a>" to do so. Elisa faces a series of psionics, led by <a href="/doctor-october/4005-72045/" data-ref-id="4005-72045"> Dr. October</a>, a woman who wanted to eliminate Elisa for being beautiful even in death. Elisa also must deal with a demon, <a href="/cameron-nemo/4005-72037/" data-ref-id="4005-72037"> Cameron Nemo</a>, which escapes from her "hell", causing much destruction, before the aid of <a href="/king-tiger/4005-44950/" data-ref-id="4005-44950"> King Tiger</a> helps her defeat the demon. Elisa also learns that her jumps, her Hell, even Nemo, are all a construct of her own imagination. Elisa begins a slow introduction to Peter, a man she sees visiting the graveyard. Elisa's teamup with <a href="/barb-wire/4005-49975/" data-ref-id="4005-49975"> Barb Wire</a>, a bounty hunter from <a href="/steel-harbor/4020-56934/" data-ref-id="4020-56934"> Steel Harbor</a>, results in Elisa receiving a warning that Archibald Scythe, a psionic from her past, is coming for her.

134	300	6811	<p style="">300 is Frank Miller's famous retelling story of the battle of Thermopylae. King Leonidas leads a Spartan army of only 300 men into battle against the army of Xerxes I of Persia, a force outnumbering them by thousands to one. The Spartans maintain a stand-still, holding off Xerxes' forces for two full days at a narrow pass known as the Hot Gates before the deformed and treacherous Ephialtes betrays the Spartans to Xerxes. This betrayal leads to the outflanking of the remaining Spartan soldiers, and their inevitable deaths on the third day. The tale ends a year later at the battle of Plataea where a now-united Greek army prepares for the final battle against Xerxes.</p><p style="">This volume would also serve as the inspiration for the 2007 film adaptation (also called 300) directed by Zach Snyder and produced by Frank Miller.</p><p style="">This volume and the resulting movie have been the source of some controversy since their respective releases. Both the comics and the movie have been heavily criticized for their polarizing depiction of the various cultures that make up the Persian army, as well as the various historical inaccuracies. Others have cited how close many of the details of the books were to historical accounts, and that the book was meant for entertainment, not political commentary.</p><ul><li>Issues #1-5 are collected in <a data-ref-id="4050-22632" href="/300/4050-22632/" slug="300">300</a> TPB/Hardcover</li></ul>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/42666-6811-48790-1-300.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/4/42666-6811-48790-1-300.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:03.23915	2015-04-07 21:12:54.240229	1998

248	Bubblegum Crisis Grand Mal	19408	<p style="">In 2031 A.D., the mega-corporation Genom is on the rise as it rebuilds the devastated Tokyo from the Second Great Kanto Earthquake with their advanced cybernetic mechanoids known as "Boomers".  But the new wave of wealth and prosperity cannot hide a growing undercurrent of violence and discontent; of a city on the verge on imploding on itself, like a bubble about to burst.  As the AD Police struggles to cope with the rise of Boomer crimes and rampages, Mega-Tokyo's only hope lies in a band of high-tech vigilantes known as the Knight Sabers.  But the Knight Sabers have problems of their own with a new high-tech opponent who threatens to destroy everything they hold dear.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/462/377155-19408-129265-1-bubblegum-crisis-gra.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/462/377155-19408-129265-1-bubblegum-crisis-gra.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:03.745742	2015-04-07 21:12:54.643674	1994

They are Terminators-indestructible killing engines hiding inside shells of flesh and blood. Tireless, fearless, merciless, unencumbered by human emotion, dedicated to the complete eradication of mankind. But despite the frailty of human flesh, nothing is as immortal as the human spirit, and even the strongest metal will bend by the will of a mother fighting for the future of her children.</p><p style="">The Terminators never sleep. They don't need food or water. The heat of the desert gives them no pause. The darkness of night does not halt their deadly gaze. Bullets won't stop them. Their humanity cannot be appealed to-because they have none. Sent from the future, their mission is clear and unrelenting: to erase the lives of any who threaten their future dominance, any who would attempt to deny the rise of the Machine. But that which man has created, man can destroy, and so . . . the war for the future begins today.</p><p style="">Dark Horse Comics has long been regarded as the heavyweight champion of adapting film blockbusters to graphic fiction, and The Terminator is one of the finest examples of bringing top comics talents to the expansion of a premier action/adventure mythos.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/3754237-01.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/3754237-01.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:04.346874	2015-04-07 21:12:55.121239	2008

This spoof contains a variety of decidedly twisted but not-so-funny animal tales, written and drawn by a variety of artists, all wrapped up behind a dynamite good-girl-with-bunny cover illustration by Art Adams! The stories include: "My True Story" and "Pet Miracles" by Rick Geary; "Horseshoes Ain't Lucky" and "Mary the Elephant" by Jerry Prosser (Exquisite Corpse) and Jack Pollock; and "The Spy" by Randy Stradley (Aliens vs. Predator) and Eric Vincent (Alien Fire). Nina Paley also contributes two pages of animal mayhem, while Mark Martin (20 Nude Dancers 20) rounds out the issue with ad parodies--or are they?</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/2024788-00.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/2024788-00.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:04.549253	2015-04-07 22:00:10.618617	1992

With reclusive Norse deity Thor and Big Ginny, Queen of the Amazons, at his side, the old god Bacchus sets out to retrieve his treasure. The combined appetites of The Gizzard, Chryson, and an adventurer with a strange fetish for museums should be enough to turn any vintage wine to vinegar, but no one is quite prepared for what lurks inside this tomb of glass.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/462/375023-21380-129116-1-bacchus.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/0/462/375023-21380-129116-1-bacchus.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:04.572629	2015-04-07 22:00:12.430782	1995

514	Pigeons from Hell	21897	<p style="">Joe R. Lansdale puts a new spin on an old classic with this four-part adaptation of master-storyteller Robert E. Howard's classic tale of terror <em>Pigeons from Hell</em>. Set in the deep south, <em>Pigeons</em> tells the story of a damned house with a wicked past whose vile form casts a shadow of death on all who dare to enter. At dusk, as the sun slumps below the horizon, scores of pigeons can be seen flocking from the house in waning sunlight. The pigeons, they say, are the souls of the damned escaping from the very bowels of Hell itself.</p><p style="">Joe R. Lansdale (author of such works as <em>Bubba Ho-Tep, The Nightrunners</em>, and <em>The Drive-In</em>) is no stranger to comics, having worked on <em>Batman, The Lone Ranger, Jonah Hex</em>, and Robert E. Howard's <em>Conan</em>. He is joined by comics newcomer Nathan Fox. Together Lansdale and Fox are a powerhouse of visual storytelling, perfectly suited for the dark and dismal world of Robert E. Howard's horror classic <em>Pigeons from Hell</em>.</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/2515406-01.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/2515406-01.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:45.722329	2015-04-07 23:18:22.150135	2008

The stories ranged from those dealing with the attack itself and the aftermath to more super heroic and fantasy based tales.

A proposed major software upgrade—an artificial intelligence—will give the system an unprecedented degree of independent decision-making power, but serious questions are raised in regard to how much control can safely be given to a non-human intelligence. In order to more fully assess the system, a new space-station habitat—a world in miniature—is developed for deployment of the fully operational system, named Spartacus. This mini-world can then be “attacked” in a series of escalating tests to assess the system’s responses and capabilities.

After almost four decades of conflict, the British invasion of Mars has ground into a bloody stalemate.

What does Spry have up his nasty little sleeve? Robert Autumn, aged gentleman adventurer and hero of Scarlet Traces, is determined to find out!

Terminal City is a place where transistor-tube robots rub elbows with old-time gangsters, where bright, shiny technologies cast deep noir shadows. The city has been in decline since a group of celebrated adventurers - Kid Gloves, the boxer; Monty Vickers, the explorer; Eno Orez, the Man of 1,000 Faces, and Cosmo Quinn, the human fly - were each disgraced or disappeared into obscurity. Now a series of strange mysteries involving an unopenable briefcase, a missing link in evolution, a daring lady in red, and an obscene skywriter brings the four men together once again, some on the side of the law, some involved in shady business, with explosive results!</p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/3504361-01.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/3504361-01.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:50.078414	2015-04-08 00:08:55.180188	2012

1988	Will Eisner's Hawks of the Seas	62938	<p style=""><em>  In 1936, a 20-year-old artist using the name Willis B. Rensie jump-started the comic-book medium. Writing and illustrating an action-packed weekly serial called "Hawks of the Seas" -a pirate adventure series set in the 18th-century Caribbean-the artist created one dynamic strip after another, honing his storytelling craft and shaping the comics medium with each one. That artist was none other than comics' grand master Will Eisner! From 1936 to 1938, Eisner's "Hawks of the Seas" weekly stories were translated into several different languages and distributed all over the world, and now they're collected here in this handsome hardcover edition. The stories themselves stand the test of time, as thrilling and exciting as they were almost 70 years ago. Featuring an introduction by comics veteran Al Williamson and a new foreword by Eisner himself.</em></p>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/12/124613/3088655-hawks+of+the+seas+v2003+%282003%29+pagecover.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/12/124613/3088655-hawks+of+the+seas+v2003+%282003%29+pagecover.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:52.571216	2015-04-08 00:29:07.402079	2003

2160	Grindhouse: Doors Open At Midnight	67910	<p style=""><strong>Grindhouse: Doors Open At Midnight</strong> is an eight-part mini-series written and lettered by British-American writer <a href="/alex-de-campi/4040-64911/" data-ref-id="4040-64911">Alex de Campi</a> (<a href="/smoke/4050-19293/" data-ref-id="4050-19293">Smoke</a>) featuring four stories that are told in two issues each and are completely independent. The series and its stories are an homage to the B-movies and drive-in cult classics of yesteryear. The four different stories feature different illustrators and colorists and alternating covers by artists <a href="/francesco-francavilla/4040-46908/" data-ref-id="4040-46908">Francesco Francavilla</a> and <a href="/dan-panosian/4040-6112/" data-ref-id="4040-6112">Dan Panosian</a>.</p><p style="">The first two-issue storyline, "<strong>Bee Vixens from Mars</strong>," is illustrated by <a href="/chris-eric-peterson/4040-68091/" data-ref-id="4040-68091">Chris Peterson</a> and colored by <a href="/nolan-woodard/4040-59061/" data-ref-id="4040-59061">Nolan Woodard</a>. In this story, an insect-like Martian "queen" attempts to recolonize the Earth, infiltrating a small Texas community through its young women. However, the invader didn't count on "bad-a$$ chica" Garcia who seems loosely based on the character One-Eye in the 1973 movie <em>Thriller: A Cruel Picture</em>.</p><p style="">The second arc is titled "<strong>Prison Ship Antares</strong>" and illustrated by <a href="/simon-fraser/4040-53019/" data-ref-id="4040-53019">Simon Fraser</a> and colored by <a href="/victoria-lau/4040-75014/" data-ref-id="4040-75014">Victoria Lau</a> and <a href="/gary-caldwell/4040-36848/" data-ref-id="4040-36848">Gary Caldwell</a> respectively. The story is a blend of movies such like <em>Chained Heat </em>and <em>Female Convict Scorpion</em> with science fiction.</p><p style="">The third storyline is titled "<strong>Bride of Blood</strong>" and illustrated by <a href="/federica-manfredi/4040-55736/" data-ref-id="4040-55736">Federica Manfredi</a> with colors from <a href="/dorotea-gizzi/4040-76618/" data-ref-id="4040-76618">Dorotea Gizzi</a> and others. The fourth and final storyline is titled "<strong>Flesh Feast of the Devil Doll</strong>" and illustrated by <a href="/gary-erskine/4040-4823/" data-ref-id="4040-4823">Gary Erskine</a> with colors from <a href="/yel-zamor/4040-71600/" data-ref-id="4040-71600">Yel Zamor</a> and others.</p><p style="">Like the movies they emulate, there is strong sexual content and graphic violence. The first issue has an excellent essay by De Campi on the title's B-movie influences, with subsequent issues featuring pieces by assistant editor <a href="//www.comicvine.com/ian-tucker/4040-69475/" data-ref-id="4040-69475">Ian Tucker</a>. Like in Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's <em>Grindhouse</em> movies, there are fake ads and movie posters at the end of each issue.</p><h4>Collected Editions</h4><ul><li><a href="http://www.comicvine.com/grindhouse-doors-open-at-midnight-1-volume-1/4000-459650/" data-ref-id="4000-459650">Grindhouse: Doors Open At Midnight vol. 1</a> (#1-4)</li><li><a href="http://www.comicvine.com/grindhouse-doors-open-at-midnight-2-volume-2/4000-471278/" data-ref-id="4000-471278">Grindhouse: Doors Open At Midnight vol. 2</a> (#5-8)</li></ul>	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/3345267-01a.jpg	http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_avatar/6/67663/3345267-01a.jpg	2015-04-06 21:51:53.391575	2015-04-08 00:52:05.763928	2013
